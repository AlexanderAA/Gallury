Gallury is an image sharing and organizing platform where images are organized by tags.

Querying is done by providing a comma-separated list of tags, where some tags may by prefixed by a - to mean that results containing that tag will not be included. Tags may be added to images in a similar manner, except that prefixing a tag with a - removes that tag from the image.
